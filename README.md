## About The Project

The Vital Proxy Tester is a powerful yet simple tool built for anyone who works with proxies. Developed with a modern tech stack (Next.js, Tauri, and Zustand), it provides a fast, beautiful, and intuitive cross-platform experience for testing your proxy lists.

No more slow, clunky, or outdated testing tools. Get instant feedback with a live-streaming results table and detailed analysis for each proxy.

### Key Features

- üöÄ **High-Performance Testing:** Asynchronously tests your proxies to get fast results.
- üåç **Comprehensive Data:** For each successful proxy, view Status, Latency (TTFB), IP Address, Country, City, and ISP.
- ‚ú® **Smart & Interactive UI:**
  - **Auto-Parsing:** Paste your list in almost any common format (`host:port:user:pass`, `user:pass@host:port`, etc.).
  - **Easy Actions:** Copy proxy strings/IPs, view detailed breakdowns, and manage your results with a single click.
- üîÑ **Automatic Updates:** The app notifies you when a new version is available, so you're always up-to-date.
- ‚úùÔ∏è **Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly on macOS, Windows and Linux.
