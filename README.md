- ‚ú® **Smart & Interactive UI:**
  - **Auto-Parsing:** Paste your list in almost any common format (`host:port:user:pass`, `user:pass@host:port`, etc.).
  - **Easy Actions:** Copy proxy strings/IPs, view detailed breakdowns, and manage your results with a single click.
- üîÑ **Automatic Updates:** The app notifies you when a new version is available, so you're always up-to-date.
